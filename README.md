# Loan Default

## Problem Statement:

The financial institution aims to reduce loan defaults and improve the accuracy of its credit risk assessment model. The current challenge is the rising number of customers failing to repay loans on time, leading to increased financial losses.

The dataset contains detailed customer information such as demographics, income, credit scores, employment status, loan characteristics, and default history. However, these insights are scattered and difficult for management to interpret quickly.

### The goal of this Power BI dashboard is to:

⦁	Identify key patterns and factors associated with loan defaults

⦁	Provide a visual understanding of customer segments with high default risk

⦁	Help the risk management team make data-driven decisions about loan approvals

⦁	Discover trends across loan amounts, credit scores, employment types, etc.

⦁	Monitor monthly/annual default rates to forecast risk more accurately

### Dataset Overview:

⦁	Total records: 255,347  
⦁	Total columns: 19

⦁	Contains:  
✓ Loan details (amount, interest rate, term, purpose)  
✓ Customer profile (age, income, education, marital status)  
✓ Credit behavior (credit score, mortgage, credit lines)  
✓ Loan Default Status (target variable)

### Objectives of the Dashboard:

⦁	Measure default rate across different customer groups  
⦁	Identify high-risk loan characteristics  
⦁	Compare credit score vs default probability  
⦁	Understand how income, DTI ratio, months employed impact repayment  
⦁	Look at loan trends over years and purposes
